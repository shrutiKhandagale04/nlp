Lemmatization is the process of reducing inflected forms of a word while still ensuring that the reduced form belongs to the language. This reduced form, or root word, is called a lemma.

For example, organizes, organized and organizing are all forms of organize. Here, organize is the lemma. The inflection of a word allows you to express different grammatical categories, like tense (organized vs organize), number (trains vs train), and so on. Lemmatization is necessary because it helps you reduce the inflected forms of a word so that they can be analyzed as a single item. It can also help you normalize the text.
